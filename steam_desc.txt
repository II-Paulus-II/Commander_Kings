[h1][b] What this mod does! [/b][/h1]

Ever wanted your king to command a legion? Well now you can!

If the laws of a nation allow a legion to be created then a decision becomes available to take command of a legion.

Consuls can now command legions
Relinquish command bug now fixed
If your ruler is deposed but remains in command of a legion army - decision can now remove him.

[h1][b] Mechanics and Functionality Update [/b] [/h1]

WE NO LONGER NEED TO APPOINT A REGENT FOR THE KING TO TAKE COMMAND OF A LEGION. The mod is therefore much simplified, and will almost certainly not conflict with other mods. Further, since the ruler is not being changed, it will not break events and content. 

This mod contains 2 decisions, a few events, and a new military window. 

Compatible with Agamidae's mod Better UI but you must load afterwards due to the fact that I have had to edit the military GUI for this mod. 

Other mods, if they touch the military GUI then incompatibility will be caused. However, my changes to the military GUI are not so much functionality as simply nice to have. 

Tested to work with Invictus also, but let me know if anything weird happens please.

[h1][b]Particular thanks to[/b][/h1]

The main man is "Crazy Zombie". He has provided russian localization and the trait icons for the mod "bloodlines". One morning we were discussing how this problem of ruler commanding legions could be solved by appointing a regent as ruler. It doesn't matter if regent commands levies or what - he just wants the king to command the legion. So this mod was born.

Thanks To Crazy Zombie once again for the trait icons.

Thanks also to Dustin on Molon Labe for some very nice localisation for the events.

Modding discord as always, cool dudes all!

Another thanks. An individual who has not given explicit permission to be named did demonstrate that there was another non-regent-appointing workaround which has simplified this mod.
